# heading1  JavaScript Programming Fundamentals

    In Javascript programming Fundamentals we were told to create a website that will give direct links to 5 elements though the homepage. Each element is used to convey different techniques.

    Element 1 is used to show the Demonstration of basic shapes, lighting, textures, shadows, and motion. 

    Element 2 demonstrates use of a 3D environment placing a selection of individual and cloned textured 
    meshes (utilising some mesh merging) within a 360-degree scene with background image, 
    textured terrain using a height map, appropriate lighting, and constrained camera motion. 

    Element 3 demostrates the a movable player mesh incorporating player functional animations.  
    Interaction between player and other objects with a physics in applied. 

    Element 4 is used to show a Graphic user interface featuring a menu system and transitions from 
    menu to an interactive scene.  At least one GUI element should change in response to scene 
    events. 

    Element 5 is used to demonstrate multiple scenes which can be switched between using a gui or scene events. Each scene should incorporate techniques explored in the module and provides the most oppurtunity to display creativity and the introduction of game like aspects.

## heading 2 Element 5

    These notes focus on the element 5 section of the webpage. Element 5 features 4 different scenes which can be swithced between using the graphical user interface displayed on the screen. i used different things i learned from the other elements and implemented them into element 5. i done this by editing lighting adding in different meshes and changes textures to display different scenes.

    1. The first scene contains 3 shapes with different textures, 2 spheres one representing the sun and the other earth and a black plane that is beneath them
    2. The second scene contains 4 shapes with textures, 3 cubes and a plane. the cubes represent boxes standing on top of one another in a stack that is sitting on a plane with the texture of grass.
    3.The third scene shows more shapes with textures such as a sphere, 3 boxes and a plane. i used these to showcase a castle on lava with a sun in the sky and i done this by texturing each shape.
    4.Scene 4 uses the base of the 2nd enviroment which includes a village with a grassy surrounding as well as a skybox. i input capsules into this to showcase them as people in the village as well as dulling the lighting to create a darker scene.

### heading 3 Extracting files

    When referencing different assets within this code i made sure that the links between the ts files went to the correct assets. When exporting this scene as well as all other elements i had to make sure it was working within a seperate development folder and extracting it locally into its own folder which would originally be the "Dist" folder but i would rename it to the required element it was. these folders includes a index.html as well as the assets and coding for the scenes in order for them to work.
